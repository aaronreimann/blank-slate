![Deploy to WordPress.org](https://github.com/aaronreimann/blank-slate/workflows/Deploy%20to%20WordPress.org/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

## Description

This WordPress plugin creates a page template giving you a blank page so only the content of the page is displayed. Header and footer are totally empty. This is great for page builders (Beaver Builder, Divi, etc), landing pages and squeeze pages.
